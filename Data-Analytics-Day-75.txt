Complete Advanced Data Analytics Pack

🔹 Lesson 1: Predictive Analytics Fundamentals
==================================================
Summary:
Predictive analytics uses historical data + statistical models to forecast future outcomes.
Key steps: collect data → preprocess → train ML model → evaluate → deploy
Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA

Example:
An online store predicts next-month sales using past 12 months’ order data.


🔹 Lesson 2: Building Regression Models in Python
==================================================
Summary:
Regression helps find the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
Linear Regression: predicts continuous values
Logistic Regression: predicts binary outcomes
Evaluate using R², MAE, RMSE

Example:
Predicting house prices based on area, bedrooms, and location.


🔹 Lesson 3: Classification & Decision Trees
==================================================
Summary:
Classification separates data into categories. Decision Trees create “if-else” rules to classify outcomes.
Works well for categorical data
Visual and easy to interpret

Example:
A bank classifies loan applications as “Approved” or “Rejected” based on income, credit score, and debt.


🔹 Lesson 4: Model Evaluation & Optimization
===============================================
Summary:
To ensure accuracy and avoid overfitting:
Split data → train/test (80/20)
Use cross-validation
Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Example:
A healthcare model predicting disease risk achieved F1-score = 0.92 after hyperparameter tuning.


🔹 Lesson 5: Business Case Study – AI-Driven Sales Prediction
==============================================================
Summary:
Combining all skills:
Clean & prepare sales data
Build regression model for revenue forecasting
Use classification to predict “high-value” customers
Visualize results in Power BI dashboard

Example:
A retail company used ML to predict monthly sales with 95% accuracy, increasing ROI by 23%.
